In addition to editing your profile information, you can choose your magic features through your dashboard. You can also enter your address in the address page to send your purchased orders.

On the books and movies page, you can see the collection of Harry Potter books and movies.
In order to shade the posters as well as the name of each book or movie, the color appropriate to the poster is considered, which is implemented manually, but in this project, a suitable color recognition system is implemented for each image.

You can see and buy different products from the store. For each product, the description and details that the admin entered through the admin dashboard when adding that product can be seen. This admin has the ability to edit the information and prices of each product completely and professionally.
Considering that each product can be sold with different features (color, size, etc.), each product has the ability to choose between different options, each of which can have its own unique price, discount, and stock quantity. The admin can enter all this information through the admin page.
